Technical Implementation
The application is built using JavaScript to maintain simplicity and avoid unnecessary dependencies. The architecture follows a straightforward client-server pattern:

Application initialization fetches all posts from the json-server endpoint
Posts are rendered in a list interface on the left panel
Post selection triggers detailed view rendering on the right panel
Form submissions handle CRUD operations via REST API calls
Real-time updates refresh the interface after each operation
The codebase prioritizes readability and maintainability. Comprehensive comments are included throughout the implementation.

Known Limitations may include 
The application requires json-server to be running on port 3000
Network error handling is minimal and may result in unexpected behavior
Form validation could be more robust
Rapid user interactions may cause UI inconsistencies
Future Enhancements
Search and filtering capabilities
Post categorization system
Improved error handling and user feedback
Enhanced UI/UX with animations
Database integration (replacing json-server)
Multi-user authentication system
Media upload functionality
Development Notes
Comments are included for clarity and maintenance
Known Issues
Post selection highlighting may persist incorrectly under rapid interactions
